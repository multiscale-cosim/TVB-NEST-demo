# TVB-NEST-demo
temporary repo for a TVB-NEST demonstrator

## Topic
This repository is a demonstration for the co-simulation between TVB, NEST and Elephant.
It should be flexible and scalable to adapt to any networks simulation and run in supercomputers. <br />
It's a demonstration of a work underdevelopment: https://github.com/multiscale-cosim/TVB-NEST

## Table of Contents
1. [Installation](#installation)
2. [Example](#installation)
3. [Files](#files)

## Installation and update :<a name="installalation"></a>
For the installation, you should look at the script in the folder install. The docker file is a good example 
for finding of the missing dependency.<br />
The ubuntu_installation.sh is an incomplete script for install all the tools.

## Example<a name="example"></a>
This demonstration is based on example of NEST and TVB. It can help you to develop your own co-simulation 
but it is not optimized and it can miss some functionalities.<br />
For running th eexample, run the script nest_elephant_tvb/launcher/run.py
